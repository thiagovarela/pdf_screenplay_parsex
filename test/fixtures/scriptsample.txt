[transition] FADE IN:

[scene_heading] INT. DRISKILL HOTEL SEMINAR ROOM - DAY

[action] JOE and APRIL burst through the doors into a clean, well-lit 
[action] seminar room.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] Are we in time?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] How could they start without us? 
[dialogue] We’re the main attraction.

[action] Joe catches his breath as he leans against the podium at the 
[action] front of the room.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] (looking about          
[dialogue] the room)
[dialogue] We are?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Don’t be an idiot. You know we’ve 
[dialogue] been invited to Austin to discuss 
[dialogue] script format.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] But why is the room empty?

[action] April and Joe look out across the room - rows of empty chairs 
[action] and nary a person in sight.

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Okay, okay. Don’t panic.

[action] She takes three deep breaths. Then April looks at her watch 
[action] and smiles.

[character] APRIL (CONT’D)
[dialogue] We’re an hour early. . . . We 
[dialogue] should rehearse.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] Okay, you start. Margins?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Left, 1.5 inches. Right, 1.0 
[dialogue] inches. Top, 1.0 inches to the 
[dialogue] body, 0.5 inches to the number. 
[dialogue] Bottom, 0.5 to 1.5 inches, 
[dialogue] depending upon where the page break 
[dialogue] comes.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] Page break?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Right above you. There are rules 
[dialogue] for breaking a page. Scene headers 
[dialogue] remain attached to description. A 
[dialogue] single line of dialogue is pushed 
[dialogue] to the following page. A long 
[dialogue] dialogue passage would be split - 
[dialogue] but I’ll get to that later.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] What about fonts?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Courier, 12-point, 10-pitch. Make 
[dialogue] sure it’s a non-proportional 
[dialogue] version of Courier and avoid 
[dialogue] Courier New unless you want your 
[dialogue] script to be about 10% longer.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] What about bold-face or italics? Or 
[dialogue] a cool font like Garamond? I love 
[dialogue] to jazz up my scripts.

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Mostly, you should steer clear of 
[dialogue] bold and italics. Definitely no 
[dialogue] Garamond, no Helvetica, no Times 
[dialogue] Roman. Stick with Courier. That’s 
[dialogue] the industry standard.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] Ah . . . we’re talking about 
[dialogue] industry standards.

[] Suddenly, Joe bolts from behind the podium and runs out into:

[scene_heading] INT. DRISKILL HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

[action] Joe glances up and down the hallway, then reaches back to 
[action] open the door.

[character] JOE
[parenthetical] (calling)
[dialogue] April - come on! There’s no one 
[dialogue] here.
[page_number] 2.

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] (walking through          
[dialogue] the door)
[dialogue] A scene heading. Or a slug line, as 
[dialogue] I was taught in film school. Always 
[dialogue] CAPPED. Usually begins with INT. or 
[dialogue] EXT. What happens if we --

[scene_heading] EXT. TEXAS CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

[action] Joe looks startled as he stands with April before the seat of 
[action] Texas politics.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] How’d you do that?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] There was a cut - from the hallway 
[dialogue] to the capitol. What’d you want to 
[dialogue] do - ride in a cab?

[character] JOE
[dialogue] Dialogue margins. 

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Left, 2.5 inches. Right, 2.5 
[dialogue] inches. Of course, you can cheat 
[dialogue] those a tad.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] So, you have about 3.5 inches for 
[dialogue] each line of dialogue?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] You’ve got it. And you can sneak 
[dialogue] out another character or two to the 
[dialogue] right and no one will hold it 
[dialogue] against you.

[action] Joe jots down notes on a 3 x 5 card, studies the card for a 
[action] moment, then scribbles another note.

[character] JOE
[parenthetical] (looking up)
[dialogue] And the position of the character’s 
[dialogue] name?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] ALL CAPS, and tabbed to about 4.0 
[dialogue] to 4.2 inches, depending upon the 
[dialogue] look you like. Some writers center 
[dialogue] all characters’ names in dialogue. 
[dialogue] Personally, I don’t think it 
[dialogue] matters too much. 
[page_number] 3.

[centered] (MORE)

[character] APRIL (CONT'D)
[dialogue] The appearance of the script pages 
[dialogue] is slightly different in each case, 
[dialogue] but all are within the norm.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] Hey! What happened?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] A page break appeared in the middle 
[dialogue] of my dialogue. You use (MORE) at 
[dialogue] the bottom of the page to show that 
[dialogue] the character’s dialogue continues 
[dialogue] onto the next page. Then add 
[dialogue] (CONT’D) after the character’s name 
[dialogue] to show that the lines have roots 
[dialogue] in the previous page.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] But not everyone uses MOREs and 
[dialogue] CONT’Ds, do they?

[scene_heading] INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

[action] Joe stares up into the dome. April examines the portraits of 
[action] Texas governors on the nearby walls.

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Some writers just plan their page 
[dialogue] breaks so as to avoid them.

[character] JOE
[parenthetical] (considering)
[dialogue] What about parentheticals?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Start them about 0.5 inches to the 
[dialogue] left of the character name tab 
[dialogue] mark. In our case, that would be at 
[dialogue] 3.0 inches.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] And what are they for?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] For years, parentheticals were used 
[dialogue] to express emotion, the manner in 
[dialogue] which a character spoke her lines. 
[dialogue] Loudly, passionately, sadly, and so 
[dialogue] on. That’s frowned upon these days, 
[dialogue] but some writers still use them for 
[dialogue] bits of action.
[page_number] 4.

[character] APRIL (CONT'D)

[character] JOE
[dialogue] (going up a          
[dialogue] stairway)
[dialogue] Something like this?

[character] APRIL
[parenthetical] (following him)
[dialogue] Exactly.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] How wide are parentheticals?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Not very - about 1.5 inches. And 
[dialogue] they should wrap to the following 
[dialogue] line when they extend beyond that 
[dialogue] point.
[dialogue] (pointing to the        
[dialogue] top of the page)
[dialogue] If you place a parenthetical in the 
[dialogue] middle of a dialogue passage, it 
[dialogue] should remain distinct from the 
[dialogue] dialogue.

[scene_heading] EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVERBOAT - NIGHT

[action] A gambling boat is docked along the riverfront. April and Joe 
[action] wander about its upper deck.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] I have to ask. What happened to CUT 
[dialogue] TO:s between scenes.

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Some writers still use transitions 
[dialogue] such as CUT TO: and DISSOLVE TO: 
[dialogue] between scenes.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] Those would introduce a new scene 
[dialogue] header?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] And typically a different place 
[dialogue] and/or time. But many writers have 
[dialogue] dispensed with such transitions, 
[dialogue] feeling that a new scene header 
[dialogue] clearly signifies a cut without the 
[dialogue] need of any additional indicator.

[action] Joe gazes out at the river.
[page_number] 5.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] How did we reach the Mississippi 
[dialogue] and when did the sun set?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] If you’d rather . . .

[scene_heading] EXT. AIRPLANE - SUNSET

[action] A jet liner cruises across Texas towards the setting sun.

[scene_heading] INT. AIRPLANE

[action] A customized interior, outfitted with leather chairs and 
[action] sofas. April and Joe sip salt-encrusted margaritas.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] Is this a flashback?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Or it could be tomorrow or next 
[dialogue] month?

[action] TITLE OVER:

[] October 25, 2014

[character] APRIL (CONT’D)
[dialogue] You see, a whole year has passed.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] Okay, I didn’t notice. But I 
[dialogue] thought only DAY and NIGHT were 
[dialogue] allowed in scene headers.

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Production managers might prefer it 
[dialogue] that way, but many writers use 
[dialogue] headers as a means of depicting a 
[dialogue] particular time of day. For 
[dialogue] instance, SUNRISE, DAWN, LATE 
[dialogue] AFTERNOON and SUNSET.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] That’s allowed?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] On a writer’s draft, without a 
[dialogue] doubt.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] A writer’s draft?
[page_number] 6.

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Essentially, any draft that hasn’t 
[dialogue] been paid for. A draft to be 
[dialogue] submitted to agents, managers, 
[dialogue] producers, development execs. Or 
[dialogue] even to a screenplay competition. 
[dialogue] Those are writer’s drafts. And they 
[dialogue] should all be FIRST DRAFTs, no 
[dialogue] matter how many versions the writer 
[dialogue] has actually written.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] You really think so?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] That’s my recommendation.

[scene_heading] INT. BLUE CAMARO - DAY

[action] April drives along Austin’s Congress Avenue as Joe rides 
[action] shotgun.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] You speak any foreign languages?

[character] APRIL
[parenthetical] (in French)
[dialogue] Of course, I do. Why do you ask?

[character] JOE
[dialogue] What about action sequences?

[action] SUDDENLY, A BLACK MUSTANG

[action] Whips around a corner, racing quickly towards them.

[subheading] APRIL

[action] Punches the accelerator and --

[subheading] THE BLUE CAMARO

[action] Leaps forward, laying a trail of rubber. The Camaro takes a 
[action] screeching left, then a quick right to accelerate into --

[action] AN ALLEY BURIED IN DEEP SHADOWS

[action] Where the Camaro all too quickly runs into a dead end, just 
[action] as --

[subheading] THE BLACK MUSTANG

[action] Roars into the alley, sealing it shut.
[page_number] 7.

[subheading] APRIL

[action] Looks to Joe, fear filling his eyes.

[scene_heading] EXT. DRISKILL HOTEL PORTICO - DAY

[action] April guides a dazed and confused Joe from the Camaro towards 
[action] the front doors held open by a smiling VALET.

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] That’s one way to write an action 
[dialogue] scene. It’s a variation on the Bill 
[dialogue] Goldman style used by many pros.

[character] JOE
[parenthetical] (coming to)
[dialogue] But other writers just use standard 
[dialogue] scene headers and description for 
[dialogue] action scenes, don’t they?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Many do.

[scene_heading] INT. DRISKILL HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

[action] A confused Joe speaks into a house phone.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] I thought we were walking together.

[character] APRIL (O.S.)
[parenthetical] (filtered)
[dialogue] Well, we were, but I realized a 
[dialogue] phone call was needed.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] You’re filtered?

[] INTERCUT WITH:

[scene_heading] EXT. STATE CAPITOL - DAY

[action] With the capitol dome looming large behind her, April speaks 
[action] on her mobile phone.

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Only when you hear my voice over 
[dialogue] the phone. Radio voices and phone 
[dialogue] calls can be filtered, though it’s 
[dialogue] a convention that isn’t used as 
[dialogue] much these days.
[page_number] 8.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] Let’s try something easy. What 
[dialogue] about page numbers?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] Number each and every page, though 
[dialogue] you can start with page two. The 
[dialogue] numbers should appear in the upper 
[dialogue] right-hand corner, about 0.5 inches 
[dialogue] down and 0.75 inches from the right 
[dialogue] page edge. Those dimensions are not 
[dialogue] set in stone, but the page numbers 
[dialogue] should always be placed in the 
[dialogue] upper right-hand corner.

[scene_heading] INT. DRISKILL HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

[action] Joe strolls slowly towards the seminar room.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] You know, that pronouncement almost 
[dialogue] seemed godlike.

[character] APRIL (V.O.)
[dialogue] If it were, I probably would have 
[dialogue] spoken in a voice-over and not on 
[dialogue] the phone.

[action] Joe searches the hallway, trying to decide just where this 
[action] disembodied voice is emanating from.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] What’s a V.O. used for?

[character] APRIL (V.O.)
[dialogue] Often for narration, for a 
[dialogue] narrator’s voice. In film noir, the 
[dialogue] protagonists often filled the 
[dialogue] audience in on their thoughts or 
[dialogue] story details. Scorsese films are 
[dialogue] often filled with voice-over, as 
[dialogue] are many documentaries.

[scene_heading] INT. DRISKILL HOTEL SEMINAR ROOM - DAY

[action] Joe races past April to reach the podium first. April walks 
[action] casually past the still-empty chairs.

[action] At the podium Joe gestures with his hands as if he were 
[action] delivering a major political speech.

[action] April sneaks up behind him and mimics his gestures - until he 
[action] notices. Joe spins to confront her.
[page_number] 9.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] Why I ought’a . . .

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] I was simply demonstrating the way 
[dialogue] many writers break descriptions 
[dialogue] into shorter paragraphs. As opposed 
[dialogue] to allowing description to fill 
[dialogue] dense blocks running on for lines.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] That makes for tougher reading, 
[dialogue] doesn’t it?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] I know studio readers who claim 
[dialogue] they skip long description passages 
[dialogue] and only read dialogue.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] But there are pros who write 
[dialogue] scripts with extended description.

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] They do - but that doesn’t mean you 
[dialogue] should too. When you’re paid to 
[dialogue] write a screenplay, you just have 
[dialogue] to satisfy the people writing your 
[dialogue] checks.

[action] Joe balances on one leg atop the podium.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] But when you’re like me, you should 
[dialogue] stick to format. Is that what 
[dialogue] you’re trying to say?

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] You just want to make your script 
[dialogue] as easy a read as possible.

[action] Joe jumps down from the podium and hustles out the door just 
[action] as conference ATTENDEES begin to enter.

[character] APRIL (CONT’D)
[dialogue] By the way, the first time you 
[dialogue] introduce a character in 
[dialogue] description, you CAP his name. And 
[dialogue] when you break a dialogue passage 
[dialogue] with description, the standard is 
[dialogue] to place (CONT’D) next to the 
[dialogue] speaking character’s name.

[action] April watches as a number of people find chairs in front of 
[action] her.
[page_number] 10.

[character] APRIL (CONT’D)
[dialogue] Of course, many writers have 
[dialogue] dropped (CONT’D) from their 
[dialogue] repertoire. I mean, it’s obvious 
[dialogue] that I’m still speaking, isn’t it? 
[dialogue] And that I never stopped speaking.

[character] JOE (O.S.)
[dialogue] (shouting from       
[dialogue] beyond the door)
[dialogue] Hey, April! C’mon! There’s a 
[dialogue] barbeque at the Governor’s Mansion 
[dialogue] and a shuttle leaving in two 
[dialogue] minutes.

[character] APRIL
[parenthetical] (shouting)
[dialogue] We haven’t mentioned master scenes.

[action] A sheepish Joe slides back into the seminar room, slowly 
[action] walking to the podium.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] That one I know. No CLOSE UPs, no 
[dialogue] WIDE SHOTs, mostly no shots of any 
[dialogue] kind. Just scene headers, 
[dialogue] description and dialogue. And no 
[dialogue] scene numbers. Those only belong on 
[dialogue] shooting scripts.

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] It’s okay to sneak in a shot here 
[dialogue] and there when it’s necessary to 
[dialogue] highlight a moment or move the 
[dialogue] action along.

[character] JOE
[dialogue] Okay. I can get behind that.

[character] APRIL
[dialogue] And don’t worry. I would never let 
[dialogue] you miss a meal.

[transition] FADE OUT.

[centered] THE END
[page_number] 11.

[action] A FEW ADDITIONAL NOTES:

[action] How closely should the format presented on the above pages be 
[action] followed?

[action] Close enough so that your script at least resembles these 
[action] pages. That said, there is no absolute standard format within 
[action] the U.S. film industry. The format used by professional 
[action] screenwriters can vary considerably from writer to writer - 
[action] but overall the format used by one professional writer 
[action] generally resembles that used by another professional writer. 
[action] Nuances may vary – margins slightly different, a dash here or 
[action] there, parentheticals used this way or that or not at all – 
[action] but overall, professional screenplays fit within or near 
[action] these guidelines.

[action] Clarity is the goal. If your script’s format can be easily 
[action] read by anyone working in the film industry, then it falls 
[action] within acceptable standards.

[action] Do realize that “shooting scripts,” the form in which scripts 
[action] are most often available online, in books and at libraries, 
[action] are not the form in which most professional writers submit 
[action] their scripts. Submission scripts, sales scripts, first draft 
[action] scripts – all usually share certain characteristics: no scene 
[action] numbers, few designated camera shots and sequences generally 
[action] written in master scenes.

[action] If you’re confused about which nuances are acceptable and 
[action] which would push your script into an “out-of-format” 
[action] category, you would do well to follow these guidelines and 
[action] eliminate those questionable nuances.
